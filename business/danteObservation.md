Observation 4:
○ Observation Statement:
There are many good ideas from our survey when we asked what would lead someone to use a fitness app.
○ Supporting Data:
Some examples of great responses from this category:
.) Help making workout routine
.) App can display workouts for a particular part of the body they want to work on
.) Built-in schedule maker for workouts and when to do them
.) Ease of use. User's don't want to spend time pushing buttons when they could be working out. App should not be a burden to their workout routine.
.) Calorie tracking / tracking workout progress / tracking weight loss or gain
.) workout suggestions and diet suggestions
.) app generates daily workout plan
.) App helps keep user motivated to keep working out.
○ Team Action (if any):
It would be ideal to implement as many of these suggestions into the app as possible to increase user engagement and ensure users keep using the app. Working as a team we could assign certain features to develop. I would assume there would be some features that we would need to implement before others. For example, we should have a working leaderboard before we have a way to track calories.
