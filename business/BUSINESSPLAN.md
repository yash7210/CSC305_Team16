## Business Plan for Fitness Rivals

The business plan for Fitness Rivals consists of measuring key metrics, different channels of communication, and cost structures, along with the initial
outline of how the app will be run and why it is marketable. 

Our key metrics that we will be measuring are how many logins we have and the amount of users that are using the app. In regards to fitness key metrics,
we will be looking at a step tracker, location tracker, and a timer to measure different fitness stats. The channels of communication consist of Google Play, 
advertisements, and word of mouth in order to get the word out about the application. For costs, we will have to worry about any costs of applicable API's or
paying for in-app advertisements. However, our revenue can come from partnerships with fitness brands and advertisements.
