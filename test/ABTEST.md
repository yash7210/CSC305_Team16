#A/B Test Name: Onboarding Flow Optimization

#User Story Number: US1

#Metric: Adoption

#Hypothesis: 
The current onboarding flow may be causing friction for new users, resulting in a lower adoption rate. Simplifying the onboarding process and providing clearer guidance may lead to an increase in user sign-ups and engagement.

#Experiment:
Audiences: All new users who install the app during the test period will be included in the experiment. This ensures that the results are applicable to the target audience.
Experiment Setup: During the experiment, users will be randomly assigned to one of two variations of the onboarding flow: the control group will experience the current onboarding flow, while the experimental group will experience an optimized version.
Tracking Using Firebase Analytics: Firebase Analytics will be used to track key metrics such as:
Number of users who complete the onboarding process
Time spent in the onboarding flow
Drop-off points within the onboarding flow

#Variations:
Control Group (Variant A - Current Onboarding Flow): Users in this group will experience the existing onboarding flow, which consists of entering in basic information such as email and password, and then checking their email for a verification link. The user needs to verify their email before they can log in with their new account.
Experimental Group (Variant B - Optimized Onboarding Flow): Users in this group will experience an optimized onboarding flow, which includes the following changes:
Simplified sign-up process with fewer steps and clearer calls-to-action.
Personalized recommendations based on user preferences captured during sign-up.
Being able to log in to the app without having to initially verify their email. App usage will be limited until their email is verified, such as being unable to post to the leaderboard or social feed.
Design Work: Mockups and designs for the optimized onboarding flow will be created to visually represent the changes being tested. These designs will be reviewed and approved by the team before implementation.
Rationale: By testing variations of the onboarding flow, we can determine which approach leads to higher user adoption rates. The experimental group will provide insights into the effectiveness of the optimized onboarding flow compared to the current flow, helping us make data-driven decisions to improve user acquisition and retention.

This A/B test aims to directly address the Adoption metric by optimizing the onboarding experience to encourage more users to sign up for and engage with the FitnessRivals App.
