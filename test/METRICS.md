- Metric 1:
- Metric 2 Adoption:
    We will utilize Firebase to collect relevant data and implement blocks within the app to track user interactions. Here's how we plan to do it:

    New User Sign-ups: Firebase provides authentication functionality that allows us to track new user sign-ups automatically. We will leverage Firebase Authentication to capture data on new users joining our app.

    Leaderboard Views: To track how many times users view the leaderboard, we will implement blocks within the app that increments a counter stored in Firebase whenever the leaderboard view button is pressed. This will involve adding event listeners to the leaderboard view button and updating a cloud variable in Firebase each time the button is clicked.

    Social Feed Views: Similarly, we will track how many times users view the social feed by implementing code within the app that increments another counter stored in Firebase whenever the social feed view button is pressed. This will involve adding event listeners to the social feed view button and updating a separate cloud variable in Firebase each time the button is clicked.

    This data will enable us to assess how effectively we're onboarding new users and engaging them with key features such as the leaderboard and social feed.
